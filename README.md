## Why?

Want to track ***code quality*** in your project?

## What?

## Paying for it

As with all great services, there is a
[price](https://codeclimate.com/pricing) to pay for
using CodeClimate (with *private* projects).  
Its *easy* to fall into the trap of thinking
$99 per month is "expensive"... But I suggest you
> *Think of **CodeClimate** as a **member of your team**
> who's **job** is to  
> **code-review** and alert people when code gets better or worse*.
